## Security Best Practices for Using brain4j

### Data Protection
- Models trained with brain4j may contain sensitive information from training data
- Always sanitize and anonymize sensitive data before using it for training
- Consider data minimization principles when developing ML applications

### Model Security
- Be cautious when using models from untrusted sources
- Validate inputs to prevent injection attacks or model manipulation
- Consider implementing rate limiting for prediction endpoints

### Native Code Considerations
Since brain4j contains native C (OpenCL) code, users should be aware of:
- Potential memory safety concerns when using native functionality
- The importance of keeping the library updated to receive security patches
- Additional system-level security implications

## Security Development Process

The brain4j team follows these practices to minimize security risks:

1. Regular code reviews with security focus
2. Automated testing and static analysis
3. Dependency vulnerability scanning
4. Periodic security assessments
